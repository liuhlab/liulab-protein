"""The command line. One verb and a version, so `[project.scripts]` has something to register.

Typer, because every lab repo that ships a command line uses it: one `typer.Typer` named
`app`, `no_args_is_help=True` so a bare invocation prints help instead of nothing, and a
`version` command. A larger surface grows by mounting sub-apps with `app.add_typer`.
